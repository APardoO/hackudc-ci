    A sourcestamp represents a particular version of the source code.
    Absolute sourcestamps specify this completely, while relative sourcestamps (with revision = None) specify the latest source at the current time.
    Source stamps can also have patches; such stamps describe the underlying revision with the given patch applied.

    Note that depending on the underlying version-control system, the same revision may describe different code in different branches (e.g., SVN) or may be independent of the branch (e.g., Git).

    The ``created_at`` timestamp can be used to indicate the first time a sourcestamp was seen by Buildbot.
    This provides a reasonable default ordering for sourcestamps when more reliable information is not available.

    ssid:
        description: |
            the ID of this sourcestamp

            .. note::

                For legacy reasons, the abbreviated name ``ssid`` is used instead of canonical ``sourcestampid``.
                This might change in the future (:bug:`3509`).
